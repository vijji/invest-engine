<h3>Project Description</h3>


The idea is to create a personal investment recommendation engine that monitors the investment portfolios of large, successful investment firms. The engine would track the percentage of holdings that these firms have in companies operating in various sectors.

Whenever there is a new development, such as a decision to buy or sell a particular stock or asset by the investment firm, the system would send a notification to the user. The user can then use this information to take appropriate action with their own investments.

In summary, this system would use the investment decisions of successful firms to provide personalized investment recommendations to individual investors, helping them make informed investment decisions.


<h3>Technical Direction</h3>
<ul>
<li>Decided to use Node.js to build the backend application so that I can utilize the opportunity
to learn Node.js</li>
<li>Shopped around what are the best web frameworks available in the market that are built on top of node.js and also
lets me stay close to the node programming language</li>
<li><a href="https://www.simform.com/blog/best-nodejs-frameworks/">Article</a> helped me to quickly decide on using
Express that aligned with my requirements. 
My requirements are: 
1. Should support API development natively. 
2. Stay close to Node technology and the opportunity to explore and ability to dig under the hood
3. Low framework code and more Javascript support
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Further steps</h3>

<ul>
    <li>For each investment firm we need to parse the data about their holdings</li>
    <li>Create a list of top 10 or 15 profit making firms by filtering out from rest of the firms</li>    
    <li>For each investment firm record in the database pull their stock holdings information</li>
    <li>List out major contribution ones from each firm</li>
    <li>Build a database to store sectors - classification</li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

<h3>Notes on Node</h3>
<ul>
<li>node cli is an execution program for running javascript files</li>
<li>ts-node cli is an execution program for running typescript files. it is a typescript execution engine that complies and runs typescript files.</li>

</ul>
